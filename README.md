# interface for OPVCM BMCE and co.

This project consisted of me and https://github.com/Ghassanee/ trying to quickly confect a graphical interface for the mess that is [this bad boy right here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k2lZlVZ-8U90edRUL4o4PnxwzVvGhddo?usp=sharing), especially since OP had time constraints. 

# What did we learn ? 

if someone has the genius idea (read: very bad practice) of creating a bunch of methods that return hundreds of values with **print** functions, then you either tell them off or you just cram them into pd.DataFrames and jsonify the sh\*t out of them.

i also tinkered a bit with Reactjs and flask but at what cost ? 

# Features
***Portfolio optimisation***

***Stock info and indicators***

***A bunch of other banking shenanignans***

# Notes
- I will try to program an interface for the **Strat()** function once I get a bit of time, it seems like good practice 
- ditto re other functions that used "input()" variables  
- the notebook above was an unholy mess that no one should replicate again, we tried our best to save it even though our work would have been a lot easier if the original programmer used some data structures and layed off the print()s a bit. 
- I will try to reprogram the interface using the note above for practice 
- I'm so bitter about this that I'm complaining on a readme.
