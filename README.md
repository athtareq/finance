# finance
This project mostly consisted of trying to confect a graphical interface for the mess that is [this bad boy right here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k2lZlVZ-8U90edRUL4o4PnxwzVvGhddo?usp=sharing)

# What did we learn
if someone has the genius idea (read: very bad practice) of creating a bunch of methods that return hundreds of values with **print** functions, then you either tell them off or you just cram them into pd.DataFrames and jsonify the sh\*t out of them.

i also tinkered a bit with JavaScript, Reactjs and flask but at what cost ? 

# Feautures
***Portfolio optimisation***

***Stock info and indicators***

***A bunch of other banking shenanignans that i couldnt possibly care less about***
